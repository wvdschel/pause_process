This is a minimal Windows program that uses the Pause/Break button as a hotkey
for suspending all threads associated with the currently active window and hides
the window.

Pressing the same button again will resume the process and reveal the window
again.

Why?

I enjoy playing Monster Hunter: World, but the game doesn't have a pause function,
even when playing single player offline. Using this program, I am able to suspend
the game when I urgently need to deal with a crying baby :)
